To complete the install:

First open a PowerShell run as Administrator and run:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Close the Administrator PowerShell and open a normal PowerShell session.

Change directory to "~\AppData\Local\Programs\Chia Network\Chia Blockchain\".
    cd "~\AppData\Local\Programs\Chia Network\Chia Blockchain\"

Run the install.ps1 script located in that folder.
    .\install.ps1

Generally you then run:
    chia init
    chia generate keys

You can start a node or a farmer as follows:
    Start-Job -Name chia-node -ScriptBlock { chia start node }
or
    Start-Job -Name chia-farmer -ScriptBlock { chia start farmer }

    Get-Content ~\.\.chia\beta-1.0b4\log\debug.log -Wait

To create one k=26 proof of space plots:
    chia-create-plots -k 26 -n 1
