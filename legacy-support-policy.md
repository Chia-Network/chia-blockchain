# Legacy Software and Operating System support policy
It is the official policy of the Chia Blockchain project to deprecate support for software, (in particular python versions) as well as for 
operating systems. Chia blockchain project intends that if the release team of the given software or operating system has deprecated support for that version that this project will no longer support it. 

Said simply if the original maintainer no longer supports a given version, the project does not intend to support it either. 

## Long term support conflicts
In the event that a long term support version of an operating system uses a default python version that has been deprecated, we also intend to deprecate support for that operating system version as well. To avoid issues with installation of a new python version via chia install, breaking crucial operating system components.
