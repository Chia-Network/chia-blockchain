# Legacy Software and Operating System support policy
It is the official policy of the Chia Blockchain project to end support for software, (in particular python versions) as well as for operating systems. 

Chia blockchain project intends that if the original maintainer no longer supports a given version (software or operating system), the Chia Blockchain project does not intend to support it either following shortly after the end of official support. 

## Long term support conflicts
If a long-term support version of an operating system uses a default Python version that has lost official support, we also intend to end support for that operating system version, so as to avoid issues with installing a new Python version via Chia install, which may break crucial operating system components.
