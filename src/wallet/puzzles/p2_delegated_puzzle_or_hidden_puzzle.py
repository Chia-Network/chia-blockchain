Pay to delegated puzzle or hidden puzzle

In this puzzle program, the solution must choose either a hidden puzzle or a
delegated puzzle on a given public key.

The given public key is morphed by adding an offset from the hash of the hidden puzzle
and itself, giving a new so-called "synthetic" public key which has the hidden puzzle
hidden inside of it.

If the hidden puzzle path is taken, the hidden puzzle and original public key will be revealed
which proves that it was hidden there in the first place.

This roughly corresponds to bitcoin's taproot.
