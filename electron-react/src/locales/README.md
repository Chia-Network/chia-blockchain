# Localization

Thanks for helping to translate the GUI for Chia Blockchain.

It will be easiest to fork the chia-blochchain repository and work in your own fork.

To add translations to an existing locale, edit the messages.po file in the locale's directory.

To add a new translation, create a directory that follows the [Electron locales naming convention](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/locales).

If you are using a development build you can update the application by either re-running `sh install-gui.sh` or running the following:

```bash
npm run locale:extract
npm run locale:compile
```

Once you are ready, please [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) that targets the dev branch of chia-blockchain (to be clear, don't target the main branch).

Check in both your changed/added .po files and the files generated by `install-gui.sh` or `npm run locale:compile`.

Once your changes pass CI one of the folks with merge privileges will review and, if the review looks good, merge your changes into the dev branch. Your translations will make it into a release once the dev branch is ready for release.
