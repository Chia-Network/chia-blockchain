#
# An explanation of how this functions from a user's perspective
#
# Consider that you have some coin A that you want to create a singleton
# containing some inner puzzle I from with amount T.  We'll call the Launcher
# coin, which is created from A "Launcher" and the first iteration of the
# singleton, called the "Eve" spend, Eve.  When spent, I yields a coin
# running I' and so on in a singleton specific way described below.
#
# The structure of this on the blockchain when done looks like this
#
#   ,------------.
#   | Coin A     |
#   `------------'
#         |
#  ------------------ Atomic Transaction 1 -----------------
#         v
#   .------------.       .-------------------------------.
#   | Launcher   |------>| Eve Coin Containing Program I |
#   `------------'       `-------------------------------'
#                                        |
#  -------------------- End Transaction 1 ------------------\
#                                        |                   > The Eve coin
#  --------------- (2) Transaction With I ------------------/  may also be
#                                        |                     spent
#                                        v                     simultaneously

#
# == Practial use of singleton_top_layer.py ==
#
# 1) Designate some coin as coin A
#
# 2) call puzzle_for_singleton with that coin's name (it is the Parent of the
#    Launch coin), and the initial inner puzzle I, curried as appropriate for
#    its own purpose. Adaptations of the program I and its descendants are
#    required as below.
#
# 3) call launch_conditions_and_coinsol to get a set of "launch_conditions",
#    which will be used to spend standard coin A, and a "spend", which spends
#    the Launcher created by the application of "launch_conditions" to A in a
#    spend. These actions must be done in the same spend bundle.
#
#    One can create a SpendBundle containing the spend of A giving it the
#    argument list (() (q . launch_conditions) ()) and then append "spend" onto
#    its .coin_spends to create a combined spend bundle.
#
# 4) submit the combine spend bundle.
#
# 5) Remember the identity of the Launcher coin:
#
#      Coin(A.name(), SINGLETON_LAUNCHER_HASH, amount)
#
# A singleton has been created like this:
#
#      Coin(Launcher.name(), puzzle_for_singleton(Launcher.name(), I), amount)
#
#
# == To spend the singleton requires some host side setup ==
#
# The singleton adds an ASSERT_MY_COIN_ID to constrain it to the coin that
# matches its own conception of itself.  It consumes a "LineageProof" object
# when spent that must be constructed so.  We'll call the singleton we intend
# to spend "S".
#
# Specifically, the required puzzle is the Inner puzzle I for the parent of S
# unless S is the Eve coin, in which case it is None.
# So to spend S', the second singleton, I is used, and to spend S'', I' is used.
# We'll call this puzzle hash (or None) PH.
#
#      If this is the Eve singleton:
#
#          PH = None
#          L = LineageProof(Launcher, PH, amount)
#
#       - Note: the Eve singleton's .parent_coin_info should match Launcher here.
#
#      Otherwise
#
#          PH = ParentOf(S).inner_puzzle_hash
#          L = LineageProof(ParentOf(S).name(), PH, amount)
#
#       - Note: ParentOf(S).name is the .parent_coin_info member of the
#         coin record for S.
#
# Now the coin S can be spent.
# The puzzle to use in the spend is given by
#
#      puzzle_for_singleton(S.name(), I'.puzzle_hash())
#
# and the arguments are given by (with the argument list to I designated AI)
#
#      solution_for_singleton(L, amount, AI)
#
# Note that AI contains dynamic arguments to puzzle I _after_ the singleton
# truths.
#
#
# Adapting puzzles to the singleton
#
# 1) For the puzzle to create a coin from inside the singleton it will need the
#    following values to be added to its curried in arguments:
#
#     - A way to compute its own puzzle has for each of I' and so on. This can
#       be accomplished by giving it its uncurried puzzle hash and using
#       puzzle-hash-of-curried-function to compute it.  Although full_puzzle_hash
#       is used for some arguments, the inputs to all singleton_top_layer
#       functions is the inner puzzle.
#
#     - the name() of the Launcher coin (which you can compute from a Coin
#       object) if you're not already using it in I puzzle for some other
#       reason.
#
# 2) A non-curried argument called "singleton_truths" will be passed to your
#    program.  It is not required to use anything inside.
#
#    There is little value in not receiving this argument via the adaptations
#    below as a standard puzzle can't be used anyway. To work the result must
#    be itself a singleton, and the singleton does not change the puzzle hash
#    in an outgoing CREATE_COIN to cause it to be one.
#
#    With this modification of the program I done, I and descendants will
#    continue to produce I', I'' etc.
#
#    The actual CREATE_COIN puzzle hash will be the result of
#    this.  The Launcher ID referred to here is the name() of
#    the Launcher coin as above.
