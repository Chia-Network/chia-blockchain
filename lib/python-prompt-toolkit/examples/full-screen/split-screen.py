# somewhere, because usually the default key bindings include searching. (Press
# Ctrl-R.) It would be really annoying if the search key bindings are handled,
# but the user doesn't see any feedback. We will add the search toolbar to the
# bottom by using an HSplit.

# 2. Adding key bindings
#   --------------------

# As a demonstration, we will add just a ControlQ key binding to exit the
# application.  Key bindings are registered in a
# `prompt_toolkit.key_bindings.registry.Registry` instance. We use the
# `load_default_key_bindings` utility function to create a registry that
# already contains the default key bindings.

kb = KeyBindings()

# Now add the Ctrl-Q binding. We have to pass `eager=True` here. The reason is
# that there is another key *sequence* that starts with Ctrl-Q as well. Yes, a
# key binding is linked to a sequence of keys, not necessarily one key. So,
# what happens if there is a key binding for the letter 'a' and a key binding
# for 'ab'. When 'a' has been pressed, nothing will happen yet. Because the
# next key could be a 'b', but it could as well be anything else. If it's a 'c'
# for instance, we'll handle the key binding for 'a' and then look for a key
# binding for 'c'. So, when there's a common prefix in a key binding sequence,
# prompt-toolkit will wait calling a handler, until we have enough information.

# Now, There is an Emacs key binding for the [Ctrl-Q Any] sequence by default.
# Pressing Ctrl-Q followed by any other key will do a quoted insert. So to be
# sure that we won't wait for that key binding to match, but instead execute
# Ctrl-Q immediately, we can pass eager=True. (Don't make a habit of adding
# `eager=True` to all key bindings, but do it when it conflicts with another
# existing key binding, and you definitely want to override that behaviour.


@kb.add('c-c', eager=True)
@kb.add('c-q', eager=True)
