Chia Blockchain Documentation

The following series of documents describes the Chia Network Trunk (or consensus layer),
which is separate from the Foliage layer, which deals with coins, scripting,
and mempools.

Familiarity with either the Bitcoin or Ethereum protocols is assumed for this documentation.
The codebase is written in python, with several performance sensitive components (signatures, proof of space,
and proof of time), written in C++.
